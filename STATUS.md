# STATUS — Corp Management Platform (MVP v1.0)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Last updated** | 2026-07-16 |
| **Source of truth** | `TASKS.md` (phase-by-phase subtasks) |
| **Build health** | `tsc --noEmit` ✅ · `next lint` ✅ (0 warnings) · unit tests **49 passed**, 4 RLS integration skipped (need live Supabase env) |

> High-level rollup of `TASKS.md`. When a phase's status changes, update both files.

## Phase rollup

| Phase | Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Foundation & tooling | ✅ **Done** | Verified vs. code + hosted Supabase boot/login (0.7b). |
| 1 | Data layer (migrations & seed) | ✅ **Done** | 0001–0004 applied to linked project; local `db reset` (CLI+Docker) not re-run in this env. |
| 2 | Auth, RLS & audit | ✅ **Done** | Public sign-up disabled in dashboard; RLS deny-by-default on all 12 tables. |
| 3 | Sites registry (Story 1) | ✅ **Done** | List, create, edit, archive/restore, detail, country view. |
| 4 | Network module (Story 2) | ✅ **Done** | Devices (create+edit), ISP circuits (create), VPN links (create), IP/VLAN editor, per-row Verify, `CredentialRef`. Circuit/VPN **edit** deferred. |
| 5 | CCTV module (Story 3) | ✅ **Done** | Recorders (create+edit), cameras (create+edit, recorder-scoped), polymorphic maintenance log, per-row Verify/Edit, per-country retention-below-minimum flag. |
| 6 | Dashboard & country cards | ◻ Scaffold | KPI cards, camera health, expiring circuits, staleness pending. |
| 7 | Global search (Story 5) | 🚧 Partial | RLS-scoped `search_registry` RPC + page done; perf budget unmeasured. |
| 8 | Renewals view (Story 6) | ◻ Scaffold | 30/60/90 window query + filters pending. |
| 9 | Roles, audit view & users | 🚧 Partial | Invite route hardened (HQ-only, audited); audit-log view + user mgmt pending. |
| 10 | Cross-cutting concerns | 🚧 Ongoing | Secrets guard, verify, formatters in place; money/currency display, 50-row caps, 403/not-found sweep pending. |
| 11 | Testing & QA | 🚧 Partial | Unit + secrets/format/validation green; RLS integration + audit-immutability tests pending live env. |
| 12 | Deployment readiness | ◻ Todo | Docker image build, staging/prod projects, CI, pen-test pending. |

## What shipped in the last pass (2026-07-16) — Phase 5 (CCTV)

- **Recorders (create+edit)** — `RecorderForm`, `POST /api/recorders` + `PATCH /api/recorders/[id]` (BUS-6 optimistic concurrency, 409 on conflict, not-found handling); pages `cctv/recorders/new` + `cctv/recorders/[id]/edit`.
- **Cameras (create+edit)** — `CameraForm` scoped to a recorder (recorder picker), `POST /api/cameras` + `PATCH /api/cameras/[id]` (BUS-6); pages `cctv/cameras/new` + `cctv/cameras/[id]/edit`.
- **Maintenance logs** — `MaintenanceLogForm` + `POST /api/maintenance-logs`; one RLS-scoped picker spans devices + recorders + cameras (encoded `table:id`, split on submit); `cctv/maintenance/new`.
- **CCTV list** — per-row **Edit** + **Verify** on both tables, "+ Recorder / + Camera / + Maintenance" actions, KPI row.
- **Retention flag (5.5)** — `lib/utils/cctv.ts:isBelowRetention` compares `retention_days` to per-country `country_settings.min_retention_days` (joined recorder→site), default 30; danger chip + KPI. Unit-tested (`tests/cctv.test.ts`).

**Verification:** static only — `tsc` + `lint` + unit tests (49 passed) + code review. Not yet driven live in the running app (recommended smoke test: create/edit/verify a recorder + camera, log a maintenance event, confirm a low-retention recorder is flagged against the hosted project).

## Next up — Phase 6 (Dashboard & country cards, Story 3 & 5)

1. Per-country cards: site/device/camera counts, camera health, circuits expiring ≤90d, stale records.
2. CCTV totals + retention-below-minimum surfaced on dashboard/country view.
3. Stale computation uses `country_settings.review_cycle_months` (default 6), not a hardcoded value.

## Known deferrals / caveats

- **Circuit & VPN edit** forms not built (only create) — device-edit pattern is ready to replicate.
- **Live in-app verification** of Phase 4 flows still pending (no Supabase creds in the build env).
- **Local `supabase db reset`** (CLI + Docker) not runnable in this env — migrations confirmed via hosted apply instead.
- **Runtime + Compliance/a11y audits** not yet run (only SEC/CODE/BUS/ROB filed).
